This repository aims to follow `create-react-app`, but with LESS support enabled. All the [CRA documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) applies, plus now you can import LESS files.

## Getting started
Start your project with `npx create-react-app-less my-project`, then follow CRA docs.
